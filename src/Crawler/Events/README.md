# Earl Events

The *"Earl Events Pattern"* refers to the API that allows consumers of an [`IEarlCrawler`](https://github.com/Cryptoc1/earl/blob/develop/src/Crawler/Abstractions/IEarlCrawler.cs) to process information about the executing of a crawl.

Out-of-the-box Earl provides a collection of events that can be found adjacent to the [`ICrawlerEvents`](https://github.com/Cryptoc1/earl/blob/develop/src/Crawler/Abstractions/Events/ICrawlerEvents.cs#L18) contract.
